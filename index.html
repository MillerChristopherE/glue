			<h3>Glue Job execution for DevOPS/Data Analysts.</h3>

			<p>Glue is a job execution engine, written in Java and Groovy.
				Workflows are written in Groovy DSL (simple statements) and use
				pre-developed modules to interact with external resources e.g. DBs,
				Hadoop, Netezza, FTP etc.</p>

			<h3>Abstracting configuration from functionality</h3>

			<p>In Glue one of the main features and design goals is to always
				abstract configuration away from functionality. This means that no
				more hardcoded IPs, UserIDs and Passwords spread over 10s of
				hundreds of bash/python scripts.</p>

			<p>Scripts written for one environment can be easily ported to
				another because the configuration is done outside of each workflow.</p>

			<p>How is this done?</p>

			<p>Each Module has a configuration section in the
				/opt/glue/conf/workflow_modules.grooy where data like hosts, ips,
				usernames etc are placed. This configuration is loaded and provided
				to the Module before starting each workflow.</p>

			<p>Configurations can be changed dynamically and are re-read
				before each workflow run, such that no restart is required.</p>

			<h3>Extending via Modules</h3>

			<p>Functionality can be added to an already running and installed
				Glue instance, via dynamically loaded modules.</p>

			<p>A module abstracts away complex and repetitive interactions
				with external systems.</p>

			<p>E.g.</p>

			<p>Glue provides modules for the below systems:</p>

			<p>MySQL (via JDBC any JDBC compliant DB) Netezza HDFS Pig Hive
				FTP and SFTP</p>

			<p>These modules are called via the context in each workflow
				script:</p>

			<p>E.g. to cat through each line in each file in an HDFS
				directory do:</p>

			<pre>
				<code>context.hdfs.cat 'mydir', { line -&gt; /* do something with the text line */ }
</code>
			</pre>
