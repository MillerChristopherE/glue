This means that no more hardcoded IPs, UserIDs and Passwords spread over 10s of hundreds of bash/python scripts.\r\n\r\nScripts written for one environment can be easily ported to another because the configuration is done outside of each workflow.\r\n\r\nHow is this done?\r\n\r\nEach Module has a configuration section in the /opt/glue/conf/workflow_modules.grooy where data like hosts, ips, usernames etc are placed. This configuration is loaded and provided to the Module before starting each workflow. \r\n\r\nConfigurations can be changed dynamically and are re-read before each workflow run, such that no restart is required.\r\n\r\n### Extending via Modules\r\n\r\nFunctionality can be added to an already running and installed Glue instance, via dynamically loaded modules.\r\n\r\nA module abstracts away complex and repetitive interactions with external systems.\r\n\r\nE.g. \r\n\r\nGlue provides modules for the below systems:\r\n\r\nMySQL (via JDBC any JDBC compliant DB)\r\nNetezza\r\nHDFS\r\nPig\r\nHive\r\nFTP and SFTP\r\n\r\nThese modules are called via the context in each workflow script:\r\n\r\nE.g. to cat through each line in each file in an HDFS directory do:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontext.hdfs.cat 'mydir', { line -> /* do something with the text line */ }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nHaving trouble with Glue?\r\n\r\ncontact gerritjvv@gmail.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","tagline":"BigData Workflow Engine for Hadoop, Hbase, Netezza, Pig, Hive ..."}
